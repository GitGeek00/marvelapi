## Project Design
The design is straightforward and unconventional, intended solely to serve the project's purpose.

## Project Functionality
The project use 3 models of marvel API
1. Comics
2. Events
3. Comics Search

## Frameworks
Bootstrap is the sole framework used in the project, even though no framework is strictly necessary. Bootstrap was chosen for its ability to expedite execution.

## Libraries
The project exclusively utilizes the Crypto library because of Marvel API regulations. It's essential to hash the API keys parameter.

As the project consists of just two pages, there is a single HTML page that operates by toggling the display to show or hide sections based on the user's selection of either Comics or Events

## Comics Page
Comic pages retrieve comics filtered by a date range set to three months from the current date. Upon website load, the first ten results are displayed on the Comics page. Users can click the 
'Load More' button to fetch additional new release comics
